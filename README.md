# LLM-and-AI-agents-in-cybersecurity

This repository is a template for completing homework on the course "Machine Learning in Information Security".
It is necessary to solve the homework on generating special content for SIEM systems. The terms of reference are described in detail in the seminar.

The result of the homework must be organized according to the directory structure above and the result must be compiled into a zip file:

```
windows_correlation_rules.zip/
    ├── correlation_1/
    │   ├── i18n/
    │       ├── i18n_en.yaml
    │       └── i18n_ru.yaml
    │   └──tests/
    │   │   ├── events_1_1.json
    │   │   └── …
              └── norm_fields_1_1.json
              └── …
    │   ├── answers.json
 ...
```

## Launching the autograder

1. Prepare your work as a ZIP archive.
2. Name it `windows_correlation_rules.zip`.
3. Upload it to the root of the repository.
4. Make a `git add`, `git commit`, `git push`.

After that, the system will automatically run the check and show the result.
